        <h2>ðŸ“š What Was the Course About?</h2>
        <p>
            This course introduced me to the foundational principles of algorithm design, optimization, 
            and problem-solving techniques. It helped me understand how to tackle complex computational challenges 
            effectively and efficiently.
        </p>

        <h2>ðŸ”¢ Data Structures Studied</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1.Binary Search Tree(BST):</strong> A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure where nodes are arranged so that the left subtree contains smaller elements and the right subtree contains larger elements.</li>
            <li><strong>2.DFS and BFS(Graph travesals):</strong> DFS explores nodes as deep as possible before backtracking, while BFS explores nodes level by level.</li>
            <li><strong>3.Heap:</strong> A heap is a binary tree-based structure that maintains the heap property, where the root is the minimum (min-heap) or maximum (max-heap) element.</li>
            <li><strong>4.Sorting Algorithms:</strong> Sorting involves arranging data in a particular order (ascending or descending). Algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and bubble sort are common.</li>
            <li><strong>5.Pattern Searching:</strong> Algorithms like KMP and Rabin-Karp search for substrings efficiently within larger strings.</li>
            <li><strong>6.Graph Algorithms:</strong> Algorithms for solving graph problems include Dijkstraâ€™s (shortest path), Kruskalâ€™s (MST), etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ðŸŒŸ Connecting the Course to Real-Time Applications</h2>
        <p>
            By applying the concepts learned in this course, I developed a <strong>Parking Management System</strong>, 
            which utilizes graph algorithms to find the nearest parking spot based on user location. 
            This real-world application highlights the power of data structures and algorithms in solving practical problems.
